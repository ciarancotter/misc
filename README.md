Fever Predictor:
In August 2020, I had a bad fever that lasted for about a week. Of course, I self-isolated and was awaiting a test for Covid-19. In the meantime, I poked around with machine learning, because I had a lot of free time. I started gathering data on my temperature and I used linear regression to try and predict my next temperature. It was, of course, completely incorrect. But it's the effort that counts.

Predictor:
Around the same time as the Fever Predictor, there was uproar over the fact that the Leaving Certificate results would be predicted. Word on the street was that the government was useless. I wrote a program of my own to predict the points for UCC Computer Science based on historical data. I would like to think that had this been a normal year, my algorithm may have been correct, simple as it was.
